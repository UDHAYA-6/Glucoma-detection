Project topic - Optical Glaucoma detection using Deep Learning And Streamlit With Segmentation

1. Data collection 
	Here we are using the images dataset for this project. 

2. Data pre processing 
	It is a process of resizing all the images intop same size by using image data generator 

3. segementation 

4. Splitting of dataset 
	Training and testing 

5. Model Implementation 
	CNN algorithm 

6. Feature extraction 
	Saving the values in csv file format. 

7. Training with the CNN algorithm storing the values in the model file format as h5 file 

8. Applying the model file in the streamlit frame work 

9. Upload the image 

10. Final prediction 
	Glaucoma 
	no glaucoma 

To run The streamlit application 

open anaconda prompt 

Copy the file location 

Type cd paste the path here 

Now type streamlit run glaucoma_app.py

Upload image
